    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi! Welcome to my site, my name is Michael. I am a career musician with over 25 years of experience playing classical piano. I attended Western Washington University where I earned a Bachelor of Music in 2011 and Manhattan School of Music where I earned a Master of Music in 2014. I'm excited to be beginning my life as a computer programmer at Code Fellows and hope to settle into a nice career in the Seattle area after graduating. I have had numerous gigs as a pianist including with local symphonies and universities. I have worked for Manhattan School of Music, Western Washington University and McGill University. Places I have lived include Seattle, Bellingham, New York City and Montreal. In addition to my music jobs, I have also been an Uber Driver since February 2018, but am ready for a more professional role, hopefully with a good company.</p>
