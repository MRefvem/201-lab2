    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>Hi! Welcome to my site, my name is Michael. I am a Code Fellows student, studying for a career as a software developer, and this is my Code 201 Lab Project.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Biography. I was born in January 1988 and this year I am 32 years old. Probably the biggest thing I do is classical piano and I have been practicing for 25 years.</li>

      <li>Education History. I attended Western Washington University where I earned a Bachelor of Music in 2011 and Manhattan School of Music where I earned a Master of Music in 2014. In addition to my major degrees, I also attended music festivals as a participant in cities around the world including Miami and Prague.</li>

      <li>Work History. I have had numerous gigs as a pianist including with local symphonies and universities. I have worked for Manhattan School of Music, Western Washington University and McGill University as a staff accompanist and my responsibilities would include rehearsing with students and performing alongside them for important concerts. In addition to my music jobs, I have also been an Uber Driver since February 2018</li>

      <li>Goals. I'm excited to be beginning my life as a computer programmer at Code Fellows and hope to settle into a nice career in the Seattle area after graduating. Although this is a big change in the pace of my life, I still want to have music be a big part of it.</li>
